# Rails Facade Example

This is non-functioning code. A collection of files to start a dialogue about how to structure facades and views for things.
Start in the `controllers/some_controller.rb` file, and follow the thread from there.

## Data

There's a list of widgets shown on an index page.
That list of widgets links to a show page for a single widget.
The show page can display comments made by users of the widget.

## Contributing

Make a PR with ideas and edits for a discussion!
Also, poke holes in this. There's no way I have all use cases in my mind.
